# zxcvbn's decrypted IPAs

[telegram channel](https://t.me/zxcvbn_decrypted) where i post a bunch of decrypted IPAs. i take all the IPAs directly from a jailbroken iphone 7 running ios 15.7.3 using [frida-ios-dump](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump). 

you can request for me to decrypt any **FREE** app from the app store by [sending me a direct message on telegram](https://t.me/asdfzxcvbn0).
